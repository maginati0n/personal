Hello everyone! My name is {Your Name} and I am a System Administrator / DevOps Engineer based in Bandung. I have created this blog to document my DevOps journey and share my experiences with others.

This blog is running on Jekyll, a static site generator, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I have chosen the Piharpi theme for its clean and minimalist design, which allows me to focus on the content of my blog.

Through this blog, I hope to share my knowledge and experiences with DevOps and system administration. I will be documenting my projects, tutorials, and tips on various topics related to my field.

Thank you for joining me on this journey!!
