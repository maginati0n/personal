# Getting Started with AWS WAF: Protect Your Web Applications

![AWS WAF Architecture](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=1000,height=420,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2513lp2k8musyhmbsj53.png)

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a managed security service that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits and attacks. With AWS WAF, you can create custom security rules to block, allow, or monitor HTTP and HTTPS requests based on specific conditions.

## Key Features of AWS WAF
- **Custom Rules:** Define your own rules to filter web traffic.
- **Managed Rule Groups:** Use pre-configured rules for common threats like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Real-Time Metrics:** Monitor traffic and blocked requests using AWS CloudWatch.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Amazon CloudFront, Application Load Balancer, and API Gateway.

## Benefits
- Protects against common web attacks
- Easy to deploy and manage
- Scalable for any size application
- Detailed logging and monitoring

## Example Use Cases
- Blocking malicious IP addresses
- Preventing SQL injection and cross-site scripting
- Rate limiting requests to prevent DDoS attacks

## How to Get Started
1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to WAF & Shield.
2. Create a Web ACL (Access Control List).
3. Add rules and rule groups to your Web ACL.
4. Associate the Web ACL with your CloudFront distribution, ALB, or API Gateway.
5. Monitor traffic and adjust rules as needed.

## AWS WAF Architecture Example

Below is a simple ASCII diagram showing how AWS WAF fits into a typical web application architecture:

```
           +-------------------+
           |   User Browser    |
           +-------------------+
                    |
                    v
           +-------------------+
           |   CloudFront/CDN  |
           +-------------------+
                    |
                    v
           +-------------------+
           |      AWS WAF      |
           +-------------------+
                    |
                    v
           +-----------------------------+
           |  Application Load Balancer  |
           +-----------------------------+
                    |
                    v
           +-------------------+
           |   EC2 / ECS / S3  |
           +-------------------+
```

In this architecture:
- User requests go through CloudFront (CDN) for caching and global delivery.
- AWS WAF inspects and filters traffic for threats.
- Clean traffic is forwarded to the Application Load Balancer.
- The load balancer distributes requests to backend resources (EC2, ECS, S3, etc).
